# documentation, which will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading
# "Side Effects:". Note that you cannot put \n's in the value part of an alias
# to insert newlines (in the resulting output). You can put ^^ in the value part
# of an alias to insert a newline as if a physical newline was in the original
# file. When you need a literal { or } or , in the value part of an alias you
# have to escape them by means of a backslash (\), this can lead to conflicts

# Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it

# using this tag. The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and
# language is one of the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, JavaScript,
# Csharp (C#), C, C++, Lex, D, PHP, md (Markdown), Objective-C, Python, Slice,
# VHDL, Fortran (fixed format Fortran: FortranFixed, free formatted Fortran:
# FortranFree, unknown formatted Fortran: Fortran. In the later case the parser
# tries to guess whether the code is fixed or free formatted code, this is the
# default for Fortran type files). For instance to make doxygen treat .inc files
# as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C (default is Fortran),
# use: inc=Fortran f=C.
